# XK0-004 and XK0-005
Course files for CompTIA Linux+ XK0-004 and XK0-005.

# What is this?
Tess Sluijter-Stek teaches the Linux+ curriculum, on Unixerius' behalf.

The classes in this Linux+ track include a large number of labs and exercises. We thought it could be beneficial to students world-wide, if we shared these exercises publicly.

The lab instructions are updated for the latest version of the Linux+ exam.
