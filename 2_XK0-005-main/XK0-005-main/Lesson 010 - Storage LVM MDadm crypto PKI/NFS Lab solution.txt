On the Ubuntu VM, you will need to install an NFS server.

After that, you will need to configure it to export /var/userdata as a share.

First find and install the right packages. Then find the config file under /etc.

	sudo apt search nfs | grep -i server
	sudo apt install nfs-ganesha nfs-ganesha-vfs
	sudo mkdir /var/userdata
	sudo find /etc -name "ganesha*"
	sudo vi /etc/ganesha/ganesha.conf

You will need to add the following configuration to "ganesha.conf":

	EXPORT
	{
		Export_ID = 1;           # this can be any unique number
		Path = /var/userdata;
		Pseudo = /var/userdata;
		FSAL {
			Name = VFS;
		}
	}


Then continue, so the export becomes available. First find the right service, then restart the service, check the logs and test if the export is available.

	sudo systemctl list-unit-files | grep -i ganesha
	sudo systemctl restart nfs-ganesha
	sudo systemctl status nfs-ganesha

	sudo cat /var/log/ganesha/ganesha.log
	sudo showmount -e localhost
	sudo touch /var/userdata/secret.txt
 

Then, on the Fedora VM make sure there's an NFS client.

	sudo yum search nfs
	sudo yum install nfsv4-client-utils

Test if you can see the exported share and then mount it. 

	showmount -e ubuntu   
	sudo mkdir /mnt/userdata
	sudo mount -t nfs ubuntu:/var/userdata /mnt/userdata
 
Then test if you see the file that we made on Ubuntu.

	sudo ls -al /mnt/userdata/secret.txt
