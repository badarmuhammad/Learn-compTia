# Lesson plan

For the Linux+ class at IT Vitae, Tess has created a custom lesson plan with bespoke slides and lab exercises.

Next to this, we use the "Linux+ XK0-005" study guide by Blum and Bresnahan. ISBN 978-1-119-87896-4, [published by Wiley](https://www.wiley.com/en-be/CompTIA+Linux%2B+Study+Guide%3A+Exam+XK0+005%2C+5th+Edition-p-9781119878964).

Tess' lesson plan *does not* follow the order of chapters in the book, neither does it follow the CompTIA XK0-005 objectives. Instead, Tess tried to compile the learning materials in a sequence where classes build on the foundations laid in earlier classes.


## Objectives and class days

As mentioned, Tess follows a very different order from both CompTIA and Blum/Bresnahan. The following table explains which objectives are touched in which lesson.

| Lesson | Objective               |
| ------ | ----------------------- |
| 1.     | n.a.                    |
| 2.     | 1.2, 2.2, 2.4           |
| 3.     | 2.2, 2.5, 3.1, 3.3, 3.4 |
| 4.     | 3.1                     |
| 5.     | 3.1                     |
| 6.     | 1.4, 1.5, 1.7           |
| 7.     | 1.1, 1.7                |
| 8.     | 3.2, 3.4, 3.5           |
| 9.     | 1.1, 1.3                |
| 10.    | 1.3, 2.1                |
| 11.    | 1.1, 1.2, 1.4           |
| 12.    | 1.1, 1.6, 1.7, 4.5      |
| 13.    | 2.2, 2.4, 2.5           |
| 14.    | 2.1, 2.3                |
| 15.    | 1.3, 1.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 |
| 16.    | 4.4, 4.5                |
| 17.    | 3.4, 3.5                |


## Reading before class

It is recommended that students read the following chapters (from the Blum/Bresnahan book) **before** each class and before attempting the labs.

| Lesson | Chapters                   |
| ------ | -------------------------- |
| 1.     | 1, 2                       |

| 3.     | 10, 15 (permissions), 27   |
| 4.     | 4, 25                      |
| 5.     | 25                         |
