# What is this?

Vagrant is an "infrastructure-as-code" tool which we will use in lesson 008. It uses a simple configuration file and some plugins to create virtual machines for you. 

The two files in this directory can be used to automatically build the VMs which we use in class. The "001-Vagrantfile-x86" is for VirtualBox on x86 processors, while "001-Vagrantfile-ARM" is for Qemu on ARM64. 

For now, don't do anything with these files. You will learn more about all of this in lesson 008.
